Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB

Description



This project demonstrates basic Digital Image Processing techniques using MATLAB. The program includes random matrix generation, image reading, grayscale conversion, color channel manipulation, binary image creation, and histogram equalization.



The code first generates an 8×8 matrix with random intensity values. It then reads an RGB image and displays it. The image is converted to grayscale, the red color channel is extracted, a binary image is created using thresholding, and histogram equalization is applied to enhance image contrast.
