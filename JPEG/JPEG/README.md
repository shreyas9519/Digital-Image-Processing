# JPEG Compression Using MATLAB (From Scratch)

This project demonstrates a step-by-step implementation of the JPEG image compression pipeline using MATLAB, without relying on built-in JPEG functions.

## Features
- RGB to YCbCr conversion
- Chroma subsampling (4:2:0)
- 8x8 block-based DCT
- JPEG luminance quantization
- Image reconstruction
- MSE and PSNR calculation

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018a or later)
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Place `thala.jpeg` in the same folder.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script.

## Output
- Original image
- JPEG reconstructed image
- DCT coefficient visualization
